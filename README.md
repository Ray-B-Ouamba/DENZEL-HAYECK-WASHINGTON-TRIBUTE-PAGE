## TECH USED:
 HTML, CSS, 

## OPTIMIZATIONS
I would love to dynamise the page with a little bit of Javascript!

## LESSONS LEARNED:
Constructing Mr. Denzel Hayes Washington's landing page assisted in learning and mastering the use of the figcaption html tag for the first time. When an element contains media content, such as screenshots, diagrams, images, movies, or brief code snippets, it is utilized to provide a description or caption.  It also allows you to provide a caption that describes the element's content right away.
